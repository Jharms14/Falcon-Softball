    <p>The 2025 season was one to remember. Not just for the wins or losses—but for the way this group of girls came together, battled through adversity, and proved what true team character looks like.</p>

    <p>We didn’t have a perfect season on paper. But what we built was far more meaningful. From the first cold March practice to the final out of the postseason, these girls bought in. They leaned on each other. They made each other better. And they made all of us proud to wear “Falcons” across our chests.</p>

    <p>Some moments stand out: the walk-off against Ridge View, the comeback at the Ida County Invite, the defensive gem we turned against Sioux Central. But even more than that, I’ll remember the bus rides, the dugout chants, the early morning workouts, and the way this team rallied around one another in tough moments.</p>

    <p>We set goals this season—to improve our bat speed, to eliminate routine errors, and to own the strike zone on the mound. Did we achieve every one? Not always. But what we did achieve was growth. Tangible, measurable, gut-earned growth. And that’s what coaching is all about.</p>

    <p>To our seniors—thank you. Your leadership was steady, your commitment unwavering, and your impact lasting. You’ve set the tone for what it means to be part of this program.</p>

    <p>To our underclassmen—your time is now. Keep grinding. Keep asking questions. Keep raising the standard.</p>

    <p>To our families and fans—thank you for showing up, supporting loudly, and believing in these girls every step of the way.</p>

    <p>The 2025 Falcons laid a foundation. One built on grit, growth, and guts. I can’t wait to see where it takes us next.</p>
