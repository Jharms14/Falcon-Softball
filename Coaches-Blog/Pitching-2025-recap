  <h1 style="color: purple;">Coach Harms Reflects on the 2025 Softball Season</h1>
  <p><em>By: Falcon Sports Insider</em></p>

  <p><strong>OABCIG —</strong> After closing out the 2025 season with 135.1 innings pitched and 144 strikeouts, Coach Jimmie Harms sat down with us to reflect on what he described as a season “full of grit, lessons, and growth.”</p>

  <h3>Q: Coach, how would you summarize this season?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> This group refused to back down. We faced tough lineups, challenging weather, and had to develop on the fly — but these girls never flinched. From first pitch to final out, this team matured every game.</p>

  <h3>Q: The pitching numbers were some of the strongest we've seen in years — 144 strikeouts and a 1.56 WHIP. What clicked?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> Our pitchers competed. The strikeout rate (7.46 K/7) speaks for itself. They reduced walks and showed confidence in the zone. That’s a credit to their preparation and buy-in.</p>

  <h3>Q: What stood out in terms of year-over-year improvement?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> Our BB/7 dropped from 6.13 to 2.69. That’s a massive leap. That alone kept us in more games and gave our defense a chance to make plays behind them.</p>

  <h3>Q: Was there a turning point this season?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> Midseason, a freshman came in with two on and no outs and struck out the side. The energy in the dugout shifted. That was a moment where the whole team said, “we belong.”</p>

  <h3>Q: What’s your favorite stat from this year?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> Hit batters per 7 innings (HBP/7) under 1. We attacked hitters inside with confidence and still kept control.</p>

  <h3>Q: What's the offseason message?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> Don’t settle. We built something this year — but now we build on top of that. Strength, speed, confidence, leadership. Time to reload.</p>

  <h3>Q: Any final thoughts?</h3>
  <p><strong>Coach Harms:</strong> Thank you to our fans and families. Your support shows up in ways the scoreboard never can. We’ll be back. The fire’s lit.</p>
